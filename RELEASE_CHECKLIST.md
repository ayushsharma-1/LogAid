## Emergency Hotfix Process

### If critical issues are found:

```bash
# Make necessary changes
git commit -m "fix: critical issue description"
```

3. **Test thoroughly**
```bash
make test
make test-race
# Manual testing
```

4. **Release hotfix**
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Hotfix v1.0.1"
git push origin v1.0.1
```

5. **Merge back to main**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/v1.0.1
git push origin main
```
