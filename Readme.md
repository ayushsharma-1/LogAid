Project Document: LogAid 🚑
LogAid is an AI-powered command-line assistant that diagnoses terminal errors in real-time, explains their root causes in plain English, and suggests safe, up-to-date fix commands—right inside your Linux shell. Imagine a doctor for your terminal, always on call, ready to heal your workflow with precision and speed.
🎯 Problem Statement
Every developer and system administrator has faced this nightmare: you're deep in a project, running commands like sudo apt install, npm install, docker run, kubectl apply, or git push on your Ubuntu-based system, and suddenly—an error. The terminal spits out cryptic logs filled with jargon like E: Unable to locate package, npm ERR! code E404, or docker: Error response from daemon. Now what?
Here’s the painful reality of fixing it today:

Copy the Error: You highlight the messy log output with your mouse, hoping you grabbed it all.
Search or Ask: You paste it into Google, StackOverflow, or an AI tool like ChatGPT, praying for a relevant answer.
Sift Through Noise: You wade through outdated forum threads, vague blog posts, or generic AI responses that miss the mark.
Test Risky Fixes: You try a command from 2015 that might work—or might break your system even more.
Repeat: If it fails, you’re back to square one, losing time and focus.

This isn’t just annoying—it’s a productivity killer. Developers waste hours switching between their terminal and external tools, losing their train of thought. System admins risk downtime because a fix was too slow or too dangerous. The current ecosystem has no seamless, terminal-native solution that:

Captures errors automatically when commands fail.
Analyzes them instantly with AI precision.
Explains the problem in human terms.
Suggests a fix you can trust, tailored to your system.
Stays inside the shell, keeping your workflow unbroken.

LogAid obliterates this chaos. It’s the tool you didn’t know you needed—until now.
💡 LogAid Solution
LogAid is your terminal’s new best friend—a lightweight, Go-built CLI tool that turns error chaos into calm resolution. It wraps your commands, watches for trouble, and springs into action when things go wrong. No copying, no pasting, no context-switching—just answers.
How It Works (So Simple, It’s Brilliant)

Run with LogAid: Type logaid before your command, like logaid npm install.
It Watches: LogAid runs your command and silently captures everything—stdout, stderr, exit codes.
Failure Detected: If the command fails (exit code ≠ 0), LogAid kicks in.
AI Magic: It sends the logs to an AI engine (via API first, local later), which diagnoses the root cause and crafts a fix.
You Decide: LogAid shows you:
🔍 A clear, human-friendly explanation of what went wrong.
✅ A safe, system-specific command to fix it.
🔄 A prompt: “Run this fix? [Y/n]”


Fix Applied: Say yes, and LogAid executes it. Say no, and you’re back in control.

Example in Action
You type: logaid sudo apt install foo
Output fails: E: Unable to locate package foo
LogAid responds:
🔍 Issue: The package 'foo' isn’t found in your current Ubuntu repositories.
💡 Fix: Update your package list with 'sudo apt update' first.
🔄 Execute? [Y/n]:

Press Y, and LogAid runs sudo apt update. Problem solved.
What Makes LogAid Special?

Zero Context-Switching: Stays in your terminal—no browser tabs, no copy-paste.
Real-Time Power: Catches errors as they happen, not after the fact.
AI Smarts: Uses cutting-edge AI to understand logs better than any search engine.
Safety First: Validates every fix to avoid disasters (e.g., no blind rm -rf).
Built for Devs: Targets the tools you use daily—sudo, npm, docker, kubectl, git.

Initial Scope

System: Ubuntu-based distributions (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04).
Tools: sudo, npm, docker, kubectl, git—the essentials for developers and admins.

LogAid isn’t just a tool—it’s a workflow revolution. Let’s build it.
🧭 Detailed Roadmap
This roadmap is your step-by-step blueprint to bring LogAid to life. It’s exhaustive, actionable, and designed for success as an open-source powerhouse. Total timeline: ~6 months to v1.0, with room to adapt.
Phase 1: Research & Foundation (2 Weeks)
Goal: Nail the groundwork so development flies.
Week 1: Scope and Research

Define exact toolset: sudo, npm, docker, kubectl, git.
Collect 50+ real-world error logs per tool (e.g., npm ERR! 404, git push origin main: Permission denied).
Study log formats: Identify patterns like E:, ERR!, Error:.
Compare competitors (e.g., Lnav, tmuxai) to confirm LogAid’s edge.
Check name availability: GitHub, Twitter, Google—ensure LogAid is unique.

Week 2: Planning

Draft success metrics: 90% fix accuracy, <1 min response time.
Choose initial AI API: OpenAI (fast setup, reliable JSON output).
Outline repo structure: cmd/, pkg/log, pkg/ai, pkg/validate.
Deliverables:
Error pattern database (CSV/JSON).
Competitor analysis doc.
GitHub repo initialized: github.com/ayushsharma-1/LogAid.



Phase 2: Design & Prototyping (3 Weeks)
Goal: Blueprint a rock-solid system.
Week 1: Architecture

Design log capture: Real-time stdout/stderr buffering with Go’s exec.
Plan error detection: Exit code check + tool-specific regex (e.g., npm ERR!).
Sketch AI flow: Logs → API → JSON { "diagnosis": "...", "fix": "..." }.
Outline CLI: logaid <cmd>, logaid analyze <logfile>, logaid monitor.

Week 2: AI Integration

Write AI prompt template: “Analyze this log: . Diagnose the root cause and suggest a safe fix. Return JSON.”
Test with OpenAI: Send sample logs, tweak for clarity and accuracy.
Design response parser: Extract diagnosis and fix from JSON.

Week 3: Safety & UI

Plan command validation: Use which, apt-cache, npm view to verify fixes.
Mock CLI output: Color-coded (red for errors, green for fixes) with github.com/fatih/color.
Deliverables:
Full architecture diagram (Mermaid/PlantUML).
Working AI prompt (tested with 10 logs).
CLI mockup.



Phase 3: Core Development (10 Weeks)
Goal: Build a functional MVP for sudo and npm.
Weeks 1-2: Setup & Log Capture

Init Go project: go mod init github.com/ayushsharma-1/LogAid.
Build wrapper: logaid <cmd> executes via os/exec, captures output.
Add file support: logaid analyze <logfile> reads static logs.
Test with sudo apt install typo and npm install fake-pkg.

Weeks 3-4: Error Detection

Write regex for sudo (e.g., E:.*) and npm (e.g., ERR!.*).
Add exit code check: Trigger analysis on non-zero.
Log errors to temp buffer for AI.

Weeks 5-7: AI Integration

Connect to OpenAI API: $LOGAID_API_KEY env var.
Send logs, parse JSON response.
Handle edge cases: No fix found, network errors.
Test with 20+ real logs per tool.

Weeks 8-9: Fix Validation & Execution

Validate fixes: Check command existence, block risky ones (e.g., rm -rf /).
Build prompt: “Run ? [Y/n]” with bufio.Scanner.
Execute approved fixes via exec.Command.

Week 10: Polish

Add colored output: 🔍 Diagnosis, ✅ Fix.
Write usage docs: README with examples.
Deliverables:
MVP binary: Supports sudo, npm.
README with install/run instructions.



Phase 4: Expansion & Testing (6 Weeks)
Goal: Add docker, kubectl, git and harden the tool.
Weeks 1-2: Tool Expansion

Add log parsers: docker: Error, kubectl: failed, git: fatal.
Test with real failures: docker run typo, git push no-auth.
Update AI prompts for new tools.

Weeks 3-4: Testing

Build test suite: 100+ error cases across all tools.
Measure accuracy: Aim for 90% correct diagnoses.
Beta test: Share with 5-10 devs via GitHub pre-release.

Weeks 5-6: Refinement

Fix bugs from beta feedback.
Optimize: Reduce AI call time to <1s with caching.
Deliverables:
Stable binary with all 5 tools.
Test report: Accuracy, speed metrics.



Phase 5: Open-Source Launch (2 Weeks)
